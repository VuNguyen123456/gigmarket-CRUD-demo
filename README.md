**Web Demo for User Management**

This repository contains a web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users. It is built using modern web technologies such as Angular, Node.js, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, HTML, and CSS. The application is designed to showcase the interaction between a frontend client and a backend server, along with a database for persistent data storage.

**Features**

Create User: Add a new user to the system by providing relevant details.

Retrieve User(s): View details of all users or retrieve specific user information.

Update User: Modify the details of an existing user.

Delete User: Remove a user from the system.

**Technologies Used**
**Frontend**

Angular: A TypeScript-based framework for building scalable web applications.

HTML: Markup language used for structuring the frontend.

CSS: Stylesheets for designing and styling the user interface.

**Backend**

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building the server-side logic.

GraphQL: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.

**Database**
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store user information.

**Application Architecture**
The application is divided into the following components:

_Frontend:

Built using Angular for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Communicates with the backend server via GraphQL queries and mutations.

_Backend:

Implemented in Node.js to handle API requests and business logic.

Uses GraphQL to define and execute user queries and mutations.

_Database:

PostgreSQL stores user data in a relational format.

Interacts with the backend via SQL queries for CRUD operations.
